Global ConsequencesThe cumulative effect of these pollutants leads to large-scale environmental crises:Climate Change: Increased $CO_2$ levels trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to rising global temperatures and melting polar ice caps.Acid Rain: When $SO_2$ and $NO_x$ mix with water vapor in the atmosphere, they create acidic rain that destroys forests and erodes buildings.Biodiversity Loss: Many species cannot adapt to the rapid changes in their chemical environment, leading to extinction.Solutions and MitigationCombatting pollution requires a shift from "cleanup" to "prevention." Strategies include:Renewable Energy: Moving away from coal and oil to solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.Circular Economy: Emphasizing recycling and reducing single-use plastics to minimize landfill waste.Green Infrastructure: Planting urban forests and using permeable surfaces to manage rainwater runoff.
