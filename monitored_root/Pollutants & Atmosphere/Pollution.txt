Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials, known as pollutants, into the environment. These pollutants can be natural (such as volcanic ash) or created by human activity (such as trash or runoff produced by factories). Pollution damages the quality of air, water, and land, creating a chain reaction that affects every living organism on the planet.Major Types of Pollution1. Air PollutionAir pollution occurs when harmful gases, dust, and smoke are introduced into the atmosphere, causing physical and biological changes.Primary Sources: Fossil fuel combustion from vehicles, industrial emissions, and wildfires.Key Pollutants: Carbon monoxide ($CO$), Sulfur dioxide ($SO_2$), and Nitrogen oxides ($NO_x$).Impact: It leads to respiratory diseases, global warming through the greenhouse effect, and the depletion of the ozone layer.2. Water PollutionThis happens when toxic substances enter water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and oceans, getting dissolved or lying suspended in the water.Primary Sources: Industrial waste disposal, oil spills, and agricultural runoff containing pesticides and fertilizers.Eutrophication: A significant issue where excess nutrients (like phosphorus) cause algae blooms that deplete oxygen, killing fish and aquatic life.3. Soil and Land PollutionSoil pollution involves the degradation of the Earth's land surfaces, often caused by human activities and their misuse of land resources.Contributors: Non-biodegradable waste in landfills, mining, and the excessive use of chemical fertilizers in farming.Consequences: It strips the soil of essential nutrients, rendering land infertile and affecting the food chain.
